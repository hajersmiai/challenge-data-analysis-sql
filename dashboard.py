This project leverages a local SQLite database extracted from open KBO data to answer key business questions and uncover structural patterns in the Belgian economic landscape.
Using Streamlit, we offer a user-friendly web interface that allows users to interactively explore company characteristics, including:

1. Legal forms and juridical structures. 
2. Annual trends in business creation.
3. Dominant economic sectors by region and province.
4. Distribution of active vs. inactive enterprises.
5. Correlation analysis across company attributes.

The goal of this tool is to provide a compact yet powerful storytelling platform for policymakers, entrepreneurs, data analysts, and researchers who want to better understand how Belgian enterprises are structured, how they evolve, and where economic strengths lie across the country.""")
